# fileZipperBot

Before using don't forget to change the API_TOKEN

This is the simple File Zipper bot. 
But There are some limitations
1. Telegram doesn't support files over 20 mb to send over the Telegram API. If you have any solutions for it - your contribution will be much appriciated.
2. One more problem is, I have used global variables so whenever 2 users are using the bot it will overwrite the values and so code gets kinda confused. So somework will be needed there also.
3. Bot's architecure is designed in such way it takes one file from user and ask if he/she has more files or not - if some can design in such a way that it can take multiple file in one take and make a zip that will be great.

If you have any other updates or solutions then contact me on telergam at , I will give you repo access and we can work on it.
